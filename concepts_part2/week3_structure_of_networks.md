# Structure of networks

Vertices(nodes) + edges

"six degrees" -> can reach most in a few nodes -> small nodes networks, often naturally evolved

- Clustering Coefficient (cc) : Probability of edge A-B if edge A-C & B-C exists
- Path Length -> avg path between nodes usually short
- Small world network = high CC, short path

Degreee = number of intermediate vortices in a path

Degree distribution ->  probability of a node having k edges

- Exponential (quarter circle)
- Heavy tailed 
- Power law : straght line (in log graph). ie : gnutella network

Small world networks are not very resilient
